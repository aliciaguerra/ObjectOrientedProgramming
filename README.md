# Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes, and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedure can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this"). In class-based, meaning the objects are instances of classes, which also typically determines their type. <br>
Most of the most widely used programming languages are multi-paradigm programming languages that support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented programming languages include Python, C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Delphi, Java, C#, Perl, Ruby, and PHP.
#Overview
OOP attempts to provide a model based on objects. It is a modular approach, which allows the data to be applied within the stipulated programming area. It also provides the reusability feature toi develop productive logic, which means to give emphasis on data. Object-oriented programming integrates code on data using the concept of an object. An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance.An object hasboth state (data) and behavior (code). <br>
Objects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as "circle", "square", or menu". An olnine shopping system may have objects such as "shopping cart", "customer", and "product". The shopping system will support behaviors such as "place order", "make payment", and "offer discount". <br>
Objects are designed in hierarchies, commonly a class hierarchy. For example, with the shopping system, there might be high level classes such as "electronics product", "kitchen product", and "book". There may be further refinements for example under "electronic products": "CD player", "DVD player", etc. These classes anbd subclasses correspond to sets and subsets in mathematical logic. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utlizies objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain. <br>
